# Horiseon-Software-Development
For this project, I developed some pre-existing software for an online marketing company entitled Horiseon. In this role, I identified issues within the code and made adjustments to increase website functalitiy and the user interface. 


Amongst the changes I made include: adding alt tags to images, making adjustments to the syntax (ex. changing an improperly labeled div section to a nav section), adding notes, and adding a title tag. 

I have attached a screenshot of the finished project below, this is what should appear when you launch the webpage!
